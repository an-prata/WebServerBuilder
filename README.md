# WebServerBuilder
A small GUI application to quickly make web servers based on Node.js and Express.

The bottom has two text boxes, the top is the path to a local file you want to host, the bottom is the URL it should be hosted on, not including the address i.e. /my/epic/url/path. You would then connect to this URL with http://myip:myport/my/epic/url. To finish making a script, go to Express -> Add Listen, then edit the line it inserts with your own port. To do this hit, Enter Edit Mode, as you cannot have both the Editor and Block Maker active at once.
